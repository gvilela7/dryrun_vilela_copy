    "flow" taken as input parameter to the shared flow, 
        describes which part of the log is being built 
        can have one of the following values: 
            "in.req"    - pre-proxy, before any changes are made to the incoming request
            "out.req"   - pre-target, request sent to the target endpoint
            "in.res"    - post-target, before any changes are made to the response from target
            "out.res"   - post-proxy, request sent back to the client
            "error"     - when an error occurs
            "callout"   - for logging service callouts
        
    for service callout logging, the shared flow takes also the following input parameters:
        "callout.req" name of the message/request variable for the service callout
        "callout.res" name of the callout response variable in case it exists
        "callout.name" name of the service callout policy to extract metric variables (time taken)
